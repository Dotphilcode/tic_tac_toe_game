JetBrains Academy Project: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Description: This game mimics the real-life Tic-Tac-Toe game and I created it in Python. This game is played by two players, X and O. Each player takes a turn playing starting with Player X. The first player to have 3 of their symbols in a role (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) wins the game. If no more space left to play and there is no winner, then it is a tie. Enjoy playing this awesome game.
